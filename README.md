# Potholes Patched and Requested in Chicago

In this project, our group analyzed two datasets comprised of data pertaining to requested and patched potholes in the city of Chicago during the years of 2009 - 2018 for requested potholes and patched potholes in 2018 - 2024. This data comes from the Chicago Department of Transportation.

Our group collaborated and analyzed the data by utilizing different methods of code on python to acquire specific data that would answer the following questions: "What seasons do the most potholes get filled?" "On average how long does it take for a pothole to be filled?" and "Which wards have the most pothole requests?"
